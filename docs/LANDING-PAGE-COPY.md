**Headline:**
## You're Too Busy to Post on Social Media

**3 Pain Points (with icons):**

📅 **No Time**  
You're running jobs, managing crews, handling customers. Who has time to write posts every week?

🤷 **No Ideas**  
What do you even post about? Staring at a blank screen doesn't help your business grow.

📉 **Inconsistent**  
You post once, get busy, and disappear for 3 months. Customers forget you exist.
